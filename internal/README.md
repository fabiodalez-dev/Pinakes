# Internal Assets (Untracked)

This directory is where we park local-only material that must stay out of
GitHub releases (backups, experimental assets, translation scratchpads,
tooling configs, etc.). Everything inside is ignored so you can store
sensitive or noisy files safely. If you ever need a file in the repository
again, move it back out of `internal/` and update the docs accordingly.
