## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository and upload all files to the root directory of your server.
2. **Visit your site's root URL** in the browser — the guided installer starts automatically.
3. **Provide database credentials** (database must be empty).
4. **Select language** (Italian, English, or German).
5. **Configure** organization name, logo, and email notifications.
6. **Create admin account** and start cataloging.

**Email configuration**: Supports both PHP `mail()` and SMTP. Required for notifications to work (loan confirmations, due-date reminders, registration approvals, reservation alerts). Can be configured during installation or later from the admin panel.

**Post-install** (optional but recommended):
- Remove/lock the `installer/` directory (button provided on final step)
- Configure SMTP, registration policy, and CMS blocks from **Admin → Settings**
- Schedule cron jobs for automated tasks:
  ```bash
  # Notifications every hour (8 AM - 8 PM)
  0 8-20 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron/automatic-notifications.php >> /var/log/biblioteca-cron.log 2>&1

  # Full maintenance at 6 AM (handles reservation/pickup expirations)
  0 6 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron/full-maintenance.php >> /var/log/biblioteca-maintenance.log 2>&1
  ```

All frontend assets are precompiled. Works on shared hosting. No Composer or build tools required on production. All configuration values can be changed later from the admin panel.

## Story Behind the Name

**Pinakes** comes from the ancient Greek word *πίνακες* ("tables" or "catalogues"). Callimachus of Cyrene compiled the *Pinakes* around 245 BC for the Library of Alexandria: 120 scrolls that indexed more than 120,000 works with authorship, subject and location. This project borrows that same mission—organising and sharing knowledge with modern tools.

**Full documentation**: [fabiodalez-dev.github.io/Pinakes](https://fabiodalez-dev.github.io/Pinakes/)

---

## What It Does

Pinakes provides cataloging, circulation, a self-service public frontend, and REST APIs out of the box. It ships with precompiled frontend assets and a guided installer so you can deploy quickly on standard LAMP hosting.

Works out of the box. Two `.htaccess` files handle routing:
- **Root `.htaccess`**: Redirects to `/public/` or `/installer/`
- **`public/.htaccess`**: Front controller routing, security headers, CORS

### Nginx (VPS/Dedicated)
Copy `.nginx.conf.example` to your Nginx sites directory:
```bash
sudo cp .nginx.conf.example /etc/nginx/sites-available/pinakes
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/pinakes  # Edit server_name, root, PHP-FPM
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pinakes /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
